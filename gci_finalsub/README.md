I took a 4 month online data science course called GCI 2019 Winter, which Matsuo lab(U.Tokyo) organized. The participants made a slide as final submission. We praceticed to make and propose a business model, using machine learning with Big data.(didn't actually present it to the company. ) 
We used data of the company Home Credit,that runs the buisiness of lending money to relatively low-income earner.
I used clustering to predict which customers would pay back money at high ratio.
